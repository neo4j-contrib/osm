# Demo OSM Data with `spatial-algorithms` and `osm-routing-app`

To demonstrate the use of OSM data for routing and spatial algorithms, a demo app was written in
branch `algorithms` of the `osm-routing-app` by Will Lyon at https://github.com/johnymontana/osm-routing-app.

## Preparation of OSM Model

The preparation of the OSM model for routing is somewhat complex.
We have taken notes of the primary actions in the following files:

* [0 - Import and indexes](presentation-0-import-and-indexes.cypher)
* [1 - Distances](presentation-1-distances.cypher)
* [2 - Points on paths](presentation-2-points-on-paths.cypher)
* [3 - Points of interest](presentation-3-points-of-interest.cypher)
* [4 - Intersections](presentation-4-intersections.cypher)
* [5 - Polygons](presentation-5-polygons.cypher)
* [6 - Search](presentation-6-search.cypher)
* [7 - Export routing graph](presentation-7-export-routing-graph.cypher)
